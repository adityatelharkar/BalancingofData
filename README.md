# Balancing of Data for Machine Learning Model Development.

# Thyroid Type Prediction

## Problem Statement
Given a dataset with 100 records, where 80 records are negative (indicating no diabetes) and 20 records are positive (indicating diabetes), the goal is to implement effective data preprocessing techniques to balance the dataset.

## Background
In healthcare, accurately predicting diabetes is crucial for early intervention and effective treatment. However, datasets used for predictive modeling often suffer from class imbalance, where one class (e.g., negative diabetes cases) significantly outnumbers the other (e.g., positive diabetes cases). This imbalance can lead to biased models that favor the majority class, resulting in high accuracy but poor performance in identifying the minority class.
